One of the most thoroughly studied fields of research that is permeating every aspect of our daily life is deep learning. In a nutshell, it is the use of advanced, powerful hardware to implement artificial neural networks. It makes it possible to create, train, and use neural networks with many more layers than were previously considered to be infeasible.

Image caption generation has emerged as a challenging and important research area following advances in statistical language modeling and image recognition. The generation of captions from images has various practical benefits, ranging from aiding the visually impaired, to enabling the automatic and cost-saving labeling of the millions of images uploaded to the Internet daily. The field also brings together state-of-the-art models in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, two major fields in Artificial Intelligence.
